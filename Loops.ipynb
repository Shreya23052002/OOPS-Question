        "Answer:\n",
        "A @staticmethod in Python does not take any special first argument like self or cls. It behaves just like a regular function, but it's placed inside a class for organizational purposes. Since it doesn’t have access to the class or instance, it cannot access or modify class-level or instance-level data. It is useful for utility or helper functions that logically belong to the class but don’t need access to its internal state. However, static methods are not inheritance-aware, meaning they do not respond differently in subclasses unless explicitly overridden.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a @classmethod takes cls as its first argument, which refers to the class itself (not an instance of the class). This allows it to access and modify class-level data and also makes it suitable for use in factory methods, where you might want to create instances in different ways. Class methods are inheritance-aware, so if you call a class method from a subclass, the cls argument will correctly refer to the subclass, making them more flexible for building extensible designs."
